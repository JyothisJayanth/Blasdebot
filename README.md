# BlasdeBot
 Bot to search movies and anime torrents.
 It uses IMDB and MyTVDB to recognise movies. Then it uses YTS api to find available torrents.
 For anime, Nyaa.si is used.
 Clickable magnet links are available using mgnet.me
 
 Under developement.

To use it, you need to create a bot with @BotFather and get the API token. Also, you need a MyTVDB api key. Put both in utils/config.py
Install the requirements in requirements.txt.

That should be it. As I improve it myself, I'm also open to comments, feedback and suggestions.
